# HTML Element Todo List

Created in 2020 by Dustin Gulley. 
Skeleton code for having an html element starting point

## What this is
I created this to test out the html element skeleton code I created in a different repository. I just wanted to clone it and ensure it worked, and figured I could go about it by writing a quick todo list.
